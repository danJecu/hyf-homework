# Todo App in React

A project designed as part of the curriculum for HackYourFuture Denmark.


## Features

✅ Create new todo items with a description and deadline.

✅ Edit and update existing todo items.

✅ Delete existing todo items.

✅ PropType validation for one component.

✅ Custom border component to wrap any component with a black border ( I used a box shadow instead of the black border).

✅ Handling of edge cases such as empty description or deadline, and deadlines that are before the current day.
