# Website Screenshot APP

A project designed as part of the curriculum for HackYourFuture Denmark.

In this assignment I build a web application that generates a screenshot of any website based on a provided URL.

#

### The tasks completed for this website screenshot app project included:

:white_check_mark: User can enter a URL for a website and it will send back a screenshot of the website using the website-screenshot API.

:white_check_mark: User can hit a button to save the screenshot. It will then save the screenshot and the URL as a resource on crudcrud.

:white_check_mark: User can get a list of all screenshots he has saved.

:white_check_mark: User can delete a screenshot he has saved.

### Future improvments:

:radio_button: Create another resource called users which takes in an email and password.

:radio_button: Get back a list of users.

:radio_button: First show a login form.

:radio_button: If the email and password matches the one user we created we show the applications else we show an error message.

:radio_button: Create another user.

:radio_button: When saving a screenshot also save the user email(or another unique identifer).

:radio_button: Make sure we are only showing screenshots that the user that is logged in has uploaded.
